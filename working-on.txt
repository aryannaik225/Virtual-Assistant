#commands that are buggy
✅ play a game ==> didnt stop unless both reached 3 score
temperature / weather ==> returns "people also ask" as thats what is at the top when you search for temperature on google
set an alarm ==> takes input on terminal instead of gui
✅ remember that ==> the speech doesnt speak everything ... easy to fix
whatsapp ==> the datetime module has no attribute "now" which is used to send the message after two minutes of confirming
schedule my day ==> when asked how many tasks ... it takes input of three instead of 3 so cant convert into integer
ipl score ==> it doesnt work
translate ==> the api isnt working so ask google to translate but it returns a whole para too about the word along with the translation
